"""
Itâ€™s important to note that ::part() offers absolutely zero new theoretical power. 
It is not a rehash of the >>> combinator, it is simply a more convenient and consistent syntax 
for something authors can already do with custom properties. By separating out the explicitly 
"published" parts of an element (the shadow part map from the sub-parts that it merely happens to 
contain, it also helps with encapsulation, as authors can use ::part() without fear of 
accidental over-styling.
